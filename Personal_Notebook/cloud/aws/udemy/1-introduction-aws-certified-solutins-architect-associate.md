### AWS Regions

how to chose a region?

- _Compliance_ with data governance and legal requirement: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
- _Poximity_ to customers: reduced latency.
- _Available services_ within a region: new services and new features are not avaiable in every region.
- _Pricing:_ pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.
